<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://silvercoin-aomh.com) -->

Website for the new and upcoming board game called Silvercoin: Age of Monster Hunters. The board game
is being developed by an amazing team of friends, who really pour their heart and soul into the project.
I am merely developing the website for the game, and I hope that you enjoy it. If you want to know more
about the team behind the project, you can find them [here](https://silvercoinaomh.com/team/). For more 
information about the game itself, you can find it [here](https://silvercoin-aomh.com).

Set in the fantasy realm of Atosia, **Silver Coin: Age of Monster Hunters** will make sure 
to take you on a journey like no other. 

Combining a **true adventure like feeling with strong euro games mechanics, Silver Coin: Age 
of Monster Hunters** offers a unique gaming experience. Bid for your character, starting 
location and initial resources, while putting your Victory Points on the line. Now you are 
ready to start your journey. 

Set off and keep your eyes on the contracts offered by the various kingdoms. Plan 
carefully and prepare, as **over 30 monsters you may face will each offer different 
challenges and get stronger depending on when and where you will face them**. Come 
unprepared, and you may face difficulties, prepare for too long and precious time 
will be lost.
